# SaveFileSystem
A simple save file system for C++ based systems

To be used freely as the user intends. 
Implements a basic savefile system for C++ based games.

TODO:

-> Add a constructor/function for loading custom save input.

-> Modify values being added to the save file according to your game.

-> Modify the encryption code.

The encryption code is a very simple and basic implementation
and is expected to be replaced by something much more competent.
